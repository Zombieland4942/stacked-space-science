    "description": "This mod adds a new rocket silo with a receipe to make stacked space science as well recipes to craft stacked satellites, allowing you to generate 1000 stacked space science per launch. Note: If you launch the stacked satellite in a regular rocket silo, you will only get 1000 normal space science."
